The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

For each orginal record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### data_tidy is a generated dataset after following steps (based on getting and cleaning data course project requirements)

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Variable name    | Description
|:-------------- |:-------------|
activityName     | Activity name which can be WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,SITTING,STANDING,LAYING
subject          | Subject ID is an interger within 1 ~30
domain           | Data colletion domain. "t" stands for time domain, "f" stands for frequency domain.
accelerationType | Acceration type which can be "Body" or "Gravity"
signalType       | Signal type which can be "Acc", "AccJerk", "Gyro", "GyroJerk".
axis             | Axis which can be "X", "Y", "Z", "Mag". Note that we consider "Mag" as a special axis in the measure.
mathMethod       | Math mothods that applied to measurements. In this case, it can be "mean()" or "std()".
value            | Mean value for the measurements from those math methods.
